Additional Lair Actions[\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93] At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) green dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:Creeper Vines. The dragon can use the vines and roots within its lair to animate up to three Humanoid corpses, which become zombies. The zombies take their turn immediately after this lair action. Each one reverts to an inanimate corpse after 1 minute, when the dragon uses this lair action again, or when the zombie is destroyed.Lashing Root. One large root or branch that is part of the lair makes a melee attack roll against a creature within 10 feet of it. It has a +7 bonus to hit and deals 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\"], ['Regional Effects'], [\"The region containing a legendary green dragon\\\\'s lair is warped by the dragon\\\\'s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects: Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon\\\\'s lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15+1d10 + 10 Dexterity saving throw once each round it\\\\'s in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon\\\\'s path.Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon\\\\'s lair serve as the dragon\\\\'s eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns. Additional Regional Effects[\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93] Either or both of these effects might appear in the area around a green dragon\\\\'s lair, in addition to or instead of those described in the Monster Manual:Inviting Whispers. Whispers rustle in the foliage within 1 mile of the dragon\\\\'s lair. The words are indistinct, but a creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or higher interprets them as an invitation to move deeper into the greenery.Twisted Messengers. The dragon can cause any Tiny Beast within 1 mile of its lair to act as its mouthpiece. The effect is horrendous, as the creature\\\\'s throat and mouth temporarily warp into a twisted version of the dragon\\\\'s own in order to allow the dragon\\\\'s voice to issue forth.\"], ['Customizing Dragons FTD p33[\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93]You can customize any dragon\\\\\\'s stat block to reflect the dragon\\\\\\'s unique character.

The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.'], ['Lair Actions'], [\"On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can\\\\'t use the same effect two rounds in a row:Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10+1d12 + 4 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7+1d12 + 1 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall\\\\'s space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies. Additional Lair Actions[\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93] At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) white dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:Blinding Sleet. Driving sleet falls in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until initiative count 20 on the next round.Whirling Wind. A strong wind blows in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon (see the Dungeon Master\\\\'s Guide for rules on strong wind). The dragon\\\\'s flying is not affected by this wind, which lasts until the next time the dragon uses a lair action or until the dragon dies.\"], ['Regional Effects'], [\"The region containing a legendary white dragon\\\\'s lair is warped by the dragon\\\\'s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon\\\\'s lair.Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the dragon\\\\'s lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when the dragon is at rest.Icy walls block off areas in the dragon\\\\'s lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days. Additional Regional Effects[\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93] Any of these effects might appear in the area around a white dragon\\\\'s lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the Monster Manual:Biting Chill. Extreme cold envelops the land within 6 miles of the dragon\\\\'s lair (see the Dungeon Master\\\\'s Guide for rules on extreme cold). If the climate in the area already features extreme cold, the cold is numbing, giving creatures in the area without immunity or resistance to cold damage disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks.Mirror Ice. The icy surfaces in the dragon\\\\'s lair reflect light like mirrors, giving creatures in the lair other than the dragon disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage, any creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.\"], ['Customizing Dragons FTD p33[\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93]You can customize any dragon\\\\\\'s stat block to reflect the dragon\\\\\\'s unique character. Minor changes such as those below are easy to make and have no impact on a dragon\\\\\\'s challenge rating. Languages. Most dragons prefer to speak Draconic but learn Common for dealing with allies and minions. But given their high Intelligence and long life span, dragons can easily learn additional languages. You can add languages to a dragon\\\\\\'s stat block. Skills. Most dragons are proficient in the Perception and Stealth skills, and many dragons have additional skill proficiencies. As with languages, you can customize a dragon\\\\\\'s skill list (even doubling their proficiency bonus with certain skills) to reflect particular interests and activities. You can also give a dragon tool proficiencies, particularly if the dragon spends time in Humanoid form. Spells. See the \"Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters\" inset(s), below. Other Traits and Actions. You can borrow traits and actions from other monsters to add unique flavor to a dragon. Consider these examples:Flyby. The dragon is an agile flier, quick to fly out of enemies\\\\\\' reach.The dragon doesn\\\\\\'t provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy\\\\\\'s reach.Mimicry. Impersonating characters or their allies could be a fun trick for a crafty dragon.The dragon can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 10+1d12 + 4 Wisdom (Insight) check.Rejuvenation. You might decide that dragons in your campaign, being an essential part of the Material Plane, are nearly impossible to destroy. A dragon\\\\\\'s life essence might be preserved in the egg from which it first emerged, in its hoard, or in a cavernous hall at the center of the world, just as a lich\\\\\\'s essence is hidden in a phylactery.If it has an essence-preserving object, a destroyed dragon gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the object.Special Senses. Most dragons have blindsight and darkvision. You might upgrade blindsight to truesight, or you could give a dragon with a burrowing speed tremorsense.Tunneler. The dragon can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a tunnel in its wake.Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters[\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93]This dragon can innately cast two spells, once per day each, requiring no material components. Each spell\\\\\\'s level can be no higher than 6th. The dragon\\\\\\'s spell save DC is DC 16+1d12 + 10, and it has +8+1d12 + 2 to hit with spell attacks.A suggested spell list is shown below, but you can also choose spells to reflect the dragon\\\\\\'s character. A dragon who innately casts druid spells feels different from one who casts warlock spells. You can also give a dragon spells of a higher level than this rule allows, but such a tweak might increase the dragon\\\\\\'s challenge rating\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94especially if those spells deal damage or impose conditions on targets.gust of windice stormSource: FTDVariant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters[\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93]Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant.A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier.
